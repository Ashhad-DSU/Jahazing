# Jahazing
In my First Semester of Computer Science, we were asked by our worthy course instructor to create a website on HTML and CSS. Looking at this, I came up with the idea of Jahazing, derived from the Urdu word "Jahaz", which means "Aeroplane". It was an online airline ticket-booking, job-seeking website.
Jahazing is a website layout of Airline ticket booking system. Moreover, a user can also know us in the ABOUT section, look at the food we serve on flight, and can also apply to join the crew as well. This project is made up of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) and Javascript. Since Bootstrap used to bound us in the creativity, so no Bootstrap was used.
It was the only project to get highest 24/25 in my class, which makes it different from the others.
